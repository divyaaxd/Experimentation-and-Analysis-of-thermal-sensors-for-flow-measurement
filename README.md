# Experimentation-and-Analysis-of-thermal-sensors-for-flow-measurement
Design and Development of a thermal flow meter with the use of thermistors and calibrated the same to devise an accurate flow measurement of liquid as small as tenths of a milliliter per minute with long-term stability and fast dynamic response.

This project was built in collaboration with QDNET Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

This project involves extensive research which required quantification of the data and typically apply statistical analysis.
